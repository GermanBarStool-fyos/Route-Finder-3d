# A_STAR PATH FINDER

A zone has this data associated with it:

- Polygon - a set of 2D vertices <br>
- 𝐻𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑚𝑖𝑛
- 𝐻𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥

You are given a Fly Zone and No Fly Zones.
Write a program that creates a path from a start point (3D) to a destination point (3D) that does not
intersect the No Fly Zones, add visual aids.

## Requirements:
Requires the following modules:
- numpy
- shapely
- plotly

## Configuration:
Modify the zones.json file as required to dictate the overall fly zone and the no-fly zones.
